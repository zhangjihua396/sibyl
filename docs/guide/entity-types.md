## Creating Entities

### Via CLI

```bash
# Episodes (default type)
sibyl add "Title" "Content"

# Specific types
sibyl add "Title" "Content" --type pattern
sibyl entity create --type rule --name "..." --content "..."
```

### Via MCP Tools

```python
# Using the add tool
add(
    title="Pattern name",
    content="Pattern description",
    entity_type="pattern",
    languages=["python"],
    category="error-handling"
)
```

### Via REST API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3334/api/entities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Entity name",
    "content": "Entity content",
    "entity_type": "pattern"
  }'
```
