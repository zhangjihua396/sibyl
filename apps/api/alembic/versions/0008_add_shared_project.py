"""Add shared project support.

Revision ID: 0008_add_shared_project
Revises: 0007_system_settings
Create Date: 2026-01-05

Adds `is_shared` column to projects table and creates a shared project
for each existing organization. The shared project holds org-wide knowledge
like conventions, crawled docs, and learnings not tied to a specific project.

Graph backfill (reassigning orphan entities) is handled separately via:
    sibyld db backfill-shared-projects
