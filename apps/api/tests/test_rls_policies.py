"""Tests for Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

These tests require a real PostgreSQL database with RLS migrations applied.
They verify that RLS policies correctly isolate data between organizations
and users.

To run these tests:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running with the Sibyl schema
2. Run: pytest apps/api/tests/test_rls_policies.py -v

Note: These tests are skipped by default in CI (no database available).
