Since we got the alien tech of Open 4.5/GPT-5.2, we can build stuff blindingly fast with a pretty high level of accuracy.
I've been thinking about ways to go even faster, and all the problems I've had building with agents. The only thing
slowing me down are how fast the agents can go, and how well I can manage parallel work. I need a system that could:
1. keep track of all the work in a super organize way
2. learn from everything we do
3. ingest docs, crawl doc sites, create embeddings, make it all super searchable
4. control a pool of coding agents, possibly from different vendors, locally or remote
5. integrate perfectly with external agents via hooks and skills

I was using Archon for awhile which could do the RAG and a little task stuff, but I wanted a lot more so over 
my "break" I built Sibyl. Sibyl is a knowledge graph system that can do all of this, with super tight agent 
integration. I have used it to blast thru so much stuff already, and I've been using it to develop itself
(which has been kind of trippy) since early on!

Still LOTS of work to do and the onboarding is still a little jank, but it's extremely promising. Looking forward
to unleaashing it on Gradial this week! AGPLv3 licensed.
